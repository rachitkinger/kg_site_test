# About me  

I study how organizations simultaneously pursue multiple and conflicting goals, focusing especially on the domain at the intersection of business and society. I use a mix of quantitative and qualitative methods to study novel contexts and industries characterized by a dual goal pursuit such as the Microfinance industry, Theatres, etc. Within these contexts, I use field experiments and natural experiments to identify causal relationships between a firmâ€™s strategy and structure; and its performance across multiple organizational goals (such as profits; and social impact or artistic excellence). My research has won several awards such as the prestigious DIIE grant award and the Academy of Management Best Paper awards.  


I hold an Honours degree in Economics from Delhi University, an MBA from IIM Lucknow and a PhD from London Business School. Before joining academia, I founded a boutique consulting firm which advised organizations across the Indian subcontinent on how to pursue profits while delivering social impact. I have been a regular speaker at a number of conferences and organizations on the topic of social entrepreneurship and sustainable business.
